# YukiOS - Agent Reference

You are working under webos-desktop directory. when src is mentioned it means webos-desktop/

## Hard Rules

- Never commit or push (git commit, git push, git add) unless explicitly asked
- Never run `npm/pnpm format` or `npm/pnpm bf`
- Never add comments — anywhere. Not in JS, not in HTML, not in CSS. Not even section dividers like
  `/* ---- Nav ---- */`. The existing codebase may have them, but you must not add new ones. Zero exceptions.
  JSDoc-style doc comments are only allowed for complex functions with non-obvious signatures.
- Never spawn a browser for testing
- Before finalizing any code changes, run `pnpm build:dev` in `webos-desktop/`. A change that breaks the build is
  incomplete.
- Always use CSS variables from `src/styles/style.css`. Never hardcode colors.
- When making significant changes, new features, or new apps: add a news entry to the top of `src/news.json` with a
  `date`, optional `label`, and `sections` array. Each section has an `icon`, `title`, and `items` (array of
  `[icon, title, description]` triples). Descriptions must be under 15 words, active-voice, and punchy. Bad: 'First-time
  setup now includes a dedicated profile step...' Good: 'Choose your nickname and avatar during setup, with a quick
  final preview!'. No punchlines or separating sentences with "—" or "-"
- Never use the "—" symbol anywhere in code, copy, or UI text. Never split punchlines or descriptions across a "-" or "—" divider. Write complete, direct sentences instead. This applies to all AI-generated text, comments, news entries, feature descriptions, and user-facing strings.
- When adding a new app, add a `description` field to its manifest entry in `src/registry/AppManifest.js`
- Always use StorageKeys from `src/StorageKeys.js` for localStorage access. Never hardcode localStorage key strings.
- Always use `ServiceKeys` from `src/ServiceKeys.js` for `os.app` service lookups and cross-app dependencies. Never
  hardcode service-key strings like `"explorerApp"` or `"sessionManager"`.
- Always use `src/framework.js` barrel for app-level imports. When writing a new app, import
  `{ BaseApp, PersistenceTypes, os, StorageKeys, ServiceKeys, APP_MANIFESTS }` from `"../framework.js"` instead of
  separate modules. Import StorageKeys and use the defined constants. If a new key is needed, add it to StorageKeys.js
  first.
- Never use this.wm.\*, always use os.window module for window operations
- Always use `os.storage` API instead of bare `localStorage`; the storage module handles serialization/deserialization
  automatically.
- Never use browser native alerts, prompts, or confirms (alert(), prompt(), confirm()). Always use the OS-level dialog
  API (`os.dialog`) instead. Use `os.dialog.alert(title, message)`, `os.dialog.confirm(title, message)`, or
  `os.dialog.prompt(title, message, defaultValue?)`. For file selection, use `os.dialog.fileOpen()` or
  `os.dialog.fileSave()`.
- Never use `document.querySelector`, `document.querySelectorAll`, or direct DOM manipulation methods. Always use the
  utility functions from `src/shared/domUtils.js` instead. Import and use `$` (querySelector), `$$` (querySelectorAll),
  `bindEvent`, `toggleClass`, `setText`, `setHTML`, `createElement`, etc. For general utility functions, use
  `src/utils/utils.js` (e.g., `formatSize`, `isImageFile`, `isTextFile`, `pluralize`).
- Use os.notify.send() sparingly and only for meaningful, discrete, user-facing events that represent a genuine state change or completion the user needs to know about. Never add notifications for trivial, low-value, or high-frequency actions (e.g., drag repositioning, hover states, layout/positional updates, theme/wallpaper previews, or any continuously-updating process). When in doubt, omit the notification. Keep existing legitimate notifications intact and add notifications if its useful to add.
- If a change introduces a new system, abstraction, manager, API surface, or reusable capability, create a new file and
  integrate it via imports. Only modify existing files if the change is a direct refinement of existing logic without
  introducing a new responsibility boundary.
- Always use `KeybindManager` from `src/keybindManager.js` for keyboard shortcuts instead of raw `keydown` listeners
  with hardcoded key checks. Use `KeybindManager.matches(event, id)` to check key combinations and register new keybinds
  in `KEYBIND_DEFINITIONS` inside that file. Never define key combos inline in event handlers.
- If user asks you to create a new app, read DEVELOPMENT.md to learn how to create a new app.
- Never use grep, instead always use rg (ripgrep)
- Never use variable or function names (or any naming convention) starting with `_` (underscore). All identifiers must
  use descriptive names without leading underscores.
- When applying changes to multiple files (2+ files), you MUST launch multiple concurrent Task sub-agents in a SINGLE
  message (one `task` tool call per sub-agent). Each sub-agent handles a SPECIFIC, NON-OVERLAPPING set of files. Never
  batch all files into one sub-agent. Never edit multiple files sequentially in your own context. Each sub-agent prompt
  must enumerate exactly which files it should edit and what changes to make. Group files by ownership/subsystem to
  avoid two agents editing the same file. Example: for a 12-file change, launch 4 sub-agents of 3 files each, not 1
  sub-agent with all 12 files.
- This rule applies to SUBSTANTIAL changes only (new features, multi-step edits, or diffs that meaningfully add
  context). Trivial edits — adding a one-line method call, inserting a single guard, renaming a reference, touching 2-3
  files with a few lines each — may be done directly from your own context. Do not spawn sub-agents for edits that take
  under a few seconds of work.

## Code Quality Guidelines

Write modular, clean, and DRY code. Follow these principles:

- **Modularity**: Separate concerns into focused modules. Each file should have a single, clear responsibility. Avoid
  monolithic files that handle multiple unrelated concerns.
- **Single Responsibility**: Functions and classes should do one thing well. If a function does more than one thing,
  split it into smaller, focused functions.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Never duplicate logic. Use shared utilities from `src/shared/` instead of
  reimplementing common functionality. If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, extract it into a
  reusable function.
- **Prefer Existing Utilities**: Before writing new utility functions, check `src/shared/` for existing helpers. Common
  patterns like dialogs, asset resolution, and platform detection already have implementations.
- **Clean Function Names**: Use descriptive, action-oriented function names. `installApp()` is better than `doIt()`.
  `validateUrl()` is better than `check()`.
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: More than 3 levels of nesting indicates a need for refactoring. Use early returns and guard
  clauses to reduce nesting.
- **Keep Functions Small**: Functions should fit on a screen (typically < 50 lines). If a function is longer, consider
  splitting it into smaller helper functions.
- **Use Meaningful Variables**: Variable names should reveal intent. `userList` is better than `data`. `isValid` is
  better than `flag`.
- **Avoid Magic Numbers/Strings**: Extract constants to the top of the file or a constants file. Use CSS variables for
  styling values.
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase. If similar apps use a certain structure, follow
  that structure for new apps.
- **Enforce KISS and YAGNI:** Write the absolute minimum code required to make current tests pass; do not build abstract
  factories, extra interfaces, or future-proof scaffolding for features that are not explicitly requested in the prompt.

## Styling System

YukiOS uses a dark glassmorphism theme with a comprehensive theming system. All rules below are non-negotiable.

- **CSS Variables**: Use `--brand` (accent), `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`,
  `--glass`, `--glass-border`, `--error`. Never introduce new hues or hardcoded values.
- **Color Hue**: All colors use unified hue 265 (purple). Never mix in gray or blue hues.
- **Glassmorphism**: `backdrop-filter: blur(32px+)`, semi-transparent `rgba` backgrounds (0.6–0.98 opacity), subtle
  borders (`rgba(255,255,255,0.08–0.12)`).
- **Depth**: Multi-layer box shadows - `0 24px 64px rgba(0,0,0,0.65)` + inset highlight.
- **Typography**: System fonts or JetBrains Mono for code. 13–16px base (minimum 12px for any readable text). Opacity
  0.7–0.9 for secondary text. Never use font-size below 12px for user-facing content unless absolutely necessary (e.g.,
  badges, timestamps).
- **Radius**: 6–14px depending on element size.
- **Transitions**: 0.1–0.2s for hover states.
- **Light Theme**: Override via `html[data-theme="light"]` with solid colors (`#fff`, `#f0f0f0`, `#111`, `#666`).
- **Scrollbars**: 8px width, `rgba(255,255,255,0.12)` thumb.
- **Checkboxes/Inputs**: Never use native browser checkboxes, plain inputs, or dropdowns. Always use `appearance: none`,
  @src/shared/selectMenu.js, and @src/shared/rangeSlider.js component. `-webkit-appearance: none`, custom
  border/background, and `::after` pseudo-element for checkmarks via CSS variables.
- **Theming System**: Comprehensive theme engine with 25+ built-in themes, transparent UI toggle, advanced brightness
  controls, and GUI scale options. Themes are managed via `settings.js` and applied through CSS variables.
- Never introduce new inline styles.
- Prefer CSS classes.
- Existing inline styles may be migrated to css classes when touched.
- New declarative UI definitions should use class names instead of style objects.

## File Size Guidelines

Target maximums:

- Utility modules: <300 lines
- Runtime modules: <500 lines
- Apps: <1000 lines

When a file exceeds these sizes:

- Prefer extracting focused modules.
- Prefer composition over adding more methods.
- New features should be added to extracted modules when possible.

## Do not increase file size when a clean extraction is feasible.

## Architecture

```
main.js initializes services
    ↓
Services (WindowManager, FileSystemManager, NotificationCenter, EventBus, TrayManager, PortManager)
    ↓
60+ Applications (all inherit BaseApp, receive injected services)
    ↓
Desktop UI renders windows, taskbar, start menu
```

The codebase is modular — facades delegate to sub-directories:

- `windowManager.js` + `windowManager/` — window lifecycle, taskbar, workspaces, snapping, tiling layout
- `desktopui/` — desktop, start menu, widgets, icon manager, drag & drop
- `fs.js` + `fs/` — IndexedDB/Electron filesystem, blob storage, trash, mounts
- `core/` — `BaseApp`, `ScramjetBaseApp`, `ScramjetWebAppFactory`, `EventBus`, `WindowRecord`
- `os/` — the `os.*` bridge API surface (`OSBridge.js`, `window.js`, `fs.js`, `dialog.js`, `storage.js`, `modes.js`)
- `services/` — `PortManager`, `ProcessManager`, `BatteryPerformanceManager`, `GitManager`, `PyodideManager`,
  `WebContainerManager`
- `modes/` — `macos/`, `chromeos/`, `steamdeck/`, `tiling/` session modes
- `games/` — `gamesList`, `gameDescriptions`, `GameLauncher`, `GameRenderer`, `GameUI`, `steam`
- `terminal/` — shell parser/interpreter, ANSI renderer, python http.server
- `shared/` — DOM utils, dialogs, asset resolver, theme engine, file kind detection

**App lifecycle:**

1. **Definition** - App class created in `src/apps/`
2. **Registration** - App added to `APP_CLASS_MAP` in `AppLoader.js` and metadata to `APP_MANIFESTS` in
   `src/registry/AppManifest.js`
3. **Instantiation** - `loadApps(os, preloaded)` in `AppLoader.js` creates one singleton instance per manifest entry and
   registers it via `os.app.register(key, instance)`
4. **Launch** - `AppLauncher.launch(appId)` dispatches
5. **Open** - `app.open()` creates window via `os.window.create()`
6. **Close** - `onClose(winId)` cleanup hook called; the window element fires a `remove` event

## OS Bridge API

The OS Bridge provides a unified API surface for applications to interact with system services. Instead of directly
accessing kernel services (WindowManager, FileSystemManager, NotificationCenter, EventBus, TrayManager, AppLauncher),
apps should use the `os.*` bridge.

**Import (preferred):**

```javascript
import { os } from "../framework.js";
```

## App Registry

### AppLauncher - `appLauncher.js`

Central dispatcher. `launch(appId, swf, extra)` is the main entry point. Routes to app instances, sandboxed iframes for
games, or the Steam overlay. Handles analytics, achievements, Steam stats, and the installed apps registry.

### gamesList - `games/gamesList.js`

Registry of games/apps. `appMap[appId]` contains `{ type, title, url, icon }`.

- Types: `"game"`, `"swf"`, `"remote"`

### gameDescriptions - `games/gameDescriptions.js`

Rich metadata per app: title, description, genre, year, developer (`descriptionMap`).

### steam - `games/steam.js`

Yuki Steam storefront: `SteamSettings` persistence, game launch handling, playtime tracking.

### appCreator - `apps/appCreator.js`

UI to create custom shortcuts to external URLs. Auto-detects favicons, supports per-app CORS proxy. Saves custom apps to
`FS_FOLDER` (`["Apps"]` in the user home) and restores them on startup.

### installedApps - `apps/installedApps.js`

App registry system for managing installed/uninstalled apps. Provides dynamic app metadata, disable/uninstall support,
and custom naming. Integrates with AppLauncher for app management.

### webApps - `apps/webApps.js`

Factory for scramjet web apps. `getWebAppClass(serviceKey)` builds a `ScramjetWebApp` class from manifest `targetUrl`
entries — no app class needed.

## File/Directory Selection Dialogs

The Explorer app provides built-in dialog methods for file and directory selection. These should be used alongside
native browser dialogs.

### Explorer Dialog Methods

**Access Explorer app from services:**

```javascript
const explorerApp = this.services.explorerApp;
```

#### `openSaveDialog(defaultFileName, onSave)`

Opens a file save dialog with Explorer UI. User can navigate directories and enter a filename.

**Parameters:**

- `defaultFileName` (string): Suggested filename for the save dialog
- `onSave` (function): Callback that receives `(path, filename)` when user clicks Save

**Usage:**

```javascript
explorerApp.openSaveDialog("myfile.txt", (path, filename) => {
  const fullPath = path.join("/");
  const filePath = `${fullPath}/${filename}`;
  await os.fs.write(fullPath, filename, content);
});
```

#### `openDirectoryDialog(onSelect)`

Opens a directory selection dialog with Explorer UI. User can navigate and select a directory.

**Parameters:**

- `onSelect` (function): Callback that receives `path` (array) when user clicks Select

**Usage:**

```javascript
explorerApp.openDirectoryDialog((path) => {
  const pathStr = path.join("/");
  await os.fs.mkdir(pathStr);
});
```

#### `open(path, callback)`

Opens Explorer in file selection mode when a callback is provided.

**Parameters:**

- `path` (array|string): Initial path to navigate to
- `callback` (function): Callback that receives selected file path when user selects a file

**Usage:**

```javascript
explorerApp.open(["Documents"], (selectedPath) => {
  console.log("Selected file:", selectedPath);
});
```

### Best Practices

- **Always use Explorer dialogs** for file/directory selection instead of `showPrompt` for manual path input
- **Use `openDirectoryDialog`** when you need the user to select a directory (e.g., save location)
- **Use `openSaveDialog`** when saving a file with a user-specified name
- **Use `open` with callback** when you need the user to select an existing file
- **Handle null/undefined returns** - callbacks may not be called if user cancels the dialog

## Adding a Web App (URL-based)

For simple web apps that just load a URL in scramjet, you can use the web app system instead of creating a full app
class. Web Apps use scramjet proxy underneath.

### Step 1: Add Entry to AppManifest.js

Add a manifest entry to `webos-desktop/src/registry/AppManifest.js` with `targetUrl` and `windowSize` fields:

```javascript
export const APP_MANIFESTS = [
  // ... existing entries
  {
    serviceKey: "myWebApp",
    enhanced: true,
    type: "system",
    title: "My Web App",
    icon: "fas fa-globe",
    launchType: "instance",
    windowIdPatterns: ["my-web-app"],
    category: "internet",
    persistContentState: false,
    clippy: { message: "Your app description here.", animation: ClippyAnimation.Show },
    description: "Brief description under 15 words for the app guide.",
    targetUrl: "https://example.com",
    windowSize: ["90vw", "85vh"]
  }
];
```

## Adding a New App

Follow these steps to create a new app. Apps extend `BaseApp` and build their UI imperatively in the `open()` method.

### 1. Create App File

Create `src/apps/myApp.js`:

```javascript
import "../styles/myApp.css";
import { BaseApp, os } from "../framework.js";

export class MyApp extends BaseApp {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services);
    this.openWindows = new Set();
  }

  open(opts = {}) {
    const winId = "my-app";
    if (this.openWindows.has(winId)) return;

    const win = os.window.create(winId, "My App", "500px", "400px", {
      icon: "fas fa-star"
    });

    win.innerHTML = `
      <div class="my-app-root">
        <p>Hello from My App!</p>
      </div>
    `;

    this.openWindows.add(winId);
    this.win = win;

    win.addEventListener("remove", () => {
      this.openWindows.delete(winId);
    });
  }

  onClose(winId) {
    this.openWindows.delete(winId);
  }
}
```

**Key patterns:**

- `open()` creates the window via `os.window.create()` — returns the window div
- Use `addEventListener()` for events, not declarative syntax
- Track open windows with `this.openWindows` (a Set) to prevent duplicates or manage instances
- The `remove` event on the window element is the cleanup hook for per-window state
- `onClose(winId)` is called by the system when a window closes

### 2. Add CSS Styling

Create `src/styles/myApp.css` with YukiOS styling:

```css
.my-app-root {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100%;
  background: var(--bg-secondary);
  padding: 16px;
  gap: 16px;
}
```

**Important:** Import the CSS at the top of your app file (as shown in step 1). Do not add `<link>` tags to
`index.html`.

### 3. Add Entry to AppManifest.js

Add manifest entry to `src/registry/AppManifest.js`:

```javascript
export const APP_MANIFESTS = [
  // ... existing entries
  {
    serviceKey: "myApp",
    type: "system",
    title: "My App",
    icon: "fas fa-star",
    launchType: "instance",
    windowIdPatterns: ["my-app"],
    category: "office",
    description: "Brief description under 15 words for the app guide."
  }
];
```

**Manifest fields:**

- `serviceKey` — Maps to the key in `APP_CLASS_MAP` in AppLoader.js (omitted for `source`-based entries)
- `enhanced` — Flag for enhanced app features
- `type` — Always `"system"` for native apps
- `title` — Display name
- `icon` — Font Awesome class (e.g. `"fas fa-star"`) or CDN URL
- `launchType` — `"instance"`, `"steam"`, `"iframe"`, `"remote"`, or `"method"`
- `windowIdPatterns` — Identifies window IDs for session restoration
- `category` — `"system"`, `"office"`, `"internet"`, `"games"`, `"graphics"`, `"development"`, `"media"`, `"help"`,
  `"utilities"`
- `clippy` (optional) — `{ message, animation }` for Clippy assistant
- `description` (optional) — App description for the guide
- `fileAssociations` (optional) — `{ extensions: [...] }` for default-app handling
- `launchMethod` (optional) — Custom method name for `launchType: "method"`
- `targetUrl` (optional) — URL for scramjet web apps, combined with `windowSize: ["90vw", "85vh"]`
- `source` (optional) — URL for `iframe`/`remote` launch types
- `trayOptions` (optional) — `{ contextMenuItems, onClick, onQuit }`
- `isHeavy` (optional) — Mark as resource-intensive
- `excludeFromInstalledApps` (optional) — Hide from Installed Apps list
- `persistContentState` (optional) — Enable session content persistence
- `onLoad` (optional) — Callback when the app instance loads

### 4. Add to AppLoader.js

Add import and entry to `APP_CLASS_MAP` in `src/AppLoader.js`:

```javascript
import { MyApp } from "./apps/myApp.js";

const APP_CLASS_MAP = {
  // ... existing entries
  myApp: MyApp
};
```

### 5. Verify Build

Run build to verify:

```bash
cd webos-desktop && pnpm build:dev
```

## App Architecture

### BaseApp Interface

All apps extend `BaseApp` (`src/core/BaseApp.js`). The base class provides:

| Method                                                        | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open(opts?)`                                                 | Create the app window — **must override** (throws by default) |
| `onClose(winId)`                                              | Lifecycle hook when a window closes                           |
| `isSingletonOpen(winId)`                                      | Check if a window already exists and focus it                 |
| `notify(title, message, type?, duration?, icon?, appSource?)` | Send a notification scoped to this app                        |
| `registerTray(winId, icon, label, options)`                   | Register with system tray                                     |
| `unregisterTray(winId)`                                       | Remove from system tray                                       |
| `sendToTray(winId)`                                           | Hide window + taskbar to tray                                 |
| `restoreFromTray(winId)`                                      | Restore window from tray                                      |
| `getSnapshot(winId)`                                          | Return state for session persistence                          |
| `restoreSnapshot(winId, data)`                                | Restore state from session                                    |

**Constructor receives:** The `os` bridge object (or services container). Apps store references to `this.wm`
(WindowManager), `this.fs` (FileSystemManager), `this.bus` (EventBus), `this.notifications` (NotificationCenter) for
direct use without `os.*` bridge.

### App Lifecycle

1. **Definition** — App class created in `src/apps/`
2. **Registration** — Class added to `APP_CLASS_MAP` in `AppLoader.js` and metadata to `APP_MANIFESTS` in
   `src/registry/AppManifest.js`
3. **Instantiation** — `loadApps(services)` in `AppLoader.js` creates one singleton instance per app class and registers
   it via `os.app.register(key, instance)`
4. **Launch** — `AppLauncher.launch(appId)` retrieves the singleton and calls `instance.open(appExtra)`
5. **Open** — `open()` creates a window via `os.window.create()`, builds UI, binds events
6. **Close** — `onClose(winId)` is called; the window element fires a `remove` event for cleanup

### Singleton Pattern

**Apps are singletons:** one instance per class, created at startup. The same instance's `open()` is called each time
the user launches the app. Multi-window apps (like Notepad) generate unique window IDs per call. Single-window apps use
`isSingletonOpen()` or a Set to prevent duplicates.

### Actual App Patterns

Three common patterns in the codebase:

**Singleton (one window at a time):**

```javascript
async open(opts) {
  if (await this.isSingletonOpen("my-app-win")) return;
  const win = os.window.create("my-app-win", "My App", "400px", "300px", { icon: "fas fa-star" });
  win.innerHTML = this.buildUI();
  // ... bind events
}
```

**Multi-instance (many windows):**

```javascript
open(opts = {}) {
  const winId = `myapp-${Date.now()}`;
  const win = os.window.create(winId, "My App", "500px", "400px", { icon: "fas fa-star" });
  this.instances.set(winId, { /* per-window state */ });
  win.addEventListener("remove", () => this.instances.delete(winId));
}
```

**Web app (URL-based):** Add an entry to `APP_MANIFESTS` with `targetUrl`, `launchType: "instance"`, and `windowSize`.
No class needed — the system creates a `ScramjetBaseApp` wrapper automatically.

## Keybind System

### KeybindManager (`src/keybindManager.js`)

Central registry of all keyboard shortcuts with customization and persistence. Always use instead of raw keydown
listeners.

| Method                         | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getAll()`                     | All keybinds with current (possibly customized) keys (includes custom actions) |
| `getById(id)`                  | Single keybind definition by ID (checks custom actions too)                    |
| `getCurrentKeys(id)`           | Current key combo for a given ID                                               |
| `setKeys(id, keys)`            | Customize a keybind (`keys` is array like `["Ctrl", "K"]`)                     |
| `reset(id)` / `resetAll()`     | Reset single or all keybinds to defaults                                       |
| `matches(event, id)`           | Check if a `KeyboardEvent` matches a keybind's current combo                   |
| `isCustomized(id)`             | Whether a keybind has been modified                                            |
| `saveCustomAction(definition)` | Create/update a custom action; auto-assigns ID if missing; returns ID          |
| `deleteCustomAction(id)`       | Remove a custom action                                                         |
| `getAllCustomActions()`        | Get array of all custom action definitions                                     |
| `getCustomAction(id)`          | Get a single custom action by ID                                               |
| `executeCustomAction(id)`      | Execute a custom action by its ID                                              |

**Key Pattern:** `scope.action` - e.g. `global.showDesktop`, `notepad.save`, `browser.newTab`.

**Usage in handlers:**

```javascript
import { KeybindManager } from "../keybindManager.js";

// Instead of: if (e.ctrlKey && e.key === "s") { save(); }
if (KeybindManager.matches(e, "notepad.save")) {
  e.preventDefault();
  save();
}
```

**Adding new keybinds:** Add an entry to `KEYBIND_DEFINITIONS` in `keybindManager.js` with an `id`, `defaultKeys`
(array), `desc`, `cat`, and `icon`. Then use `KeybindManager.matches(event, id)` in your handler.

### Shortcuts App (`src/apps/shortcuts.js`)

Opened from Start Menu. Users can search, filter by category, click a key combo to rebind it, reset individual
shortcuts, or reset all. Customizations persist via `os.storage`.

### Custom Actions

Users can create custom keyboard shortcuts with custom actions. Custom actions support four types:

- **Launch App** - Launches any registered app by its ID (e.g. `terminal`, `calculator`)
- **Open URL** - Opens a URL in a new browser tab
- **Run Code** - Executes JavaScript code with the `os` object available (`new Function("os", code)(os)`)
- **Notify** - Sends a system notification with a title and message

Custom actions are defined in the Shortcuts app via the "Custom" button. Each custom action:

1. Gets a unique ID (prefixed `custom_`)
2. Stores its keybind + action definition in `os.storage`
3. Appears under the "Custom" category in the Shortcuts app sidebar
4. Is executed by a global `keydown` listener installed automatically on creation

**Definition schema:**

```javascript
{
  id: "custom_1719000000_abcd",       // auto-generated if omitted
  defaultKeys: ["Ctrl", "Shift", "A"], // the key combination
  desc: "My custom shortcut",          // user-facing description
  icon: "fas fa-rocket",               // auto-set based on action type
  cat: "custom",                       // always "custom"
  action: {
    type: "launchApp",                 // "launchApp" | "openUrl" | "runCode" | "notify"
    config: { appId: "terminal" }      // varies by type
  }
}
```
