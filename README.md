> A browser-native multi-environment web desktop. Switch seamlessly between floating desktops (macOS, ChromeOS), dynamic
> BSP tiling (Hyprland), game consoles (Yuki Deck), all running on a single persistent client-side core built in vanilla
> JavaScript (no UI framework).

YukiOS is not just another web desktop. It is a single browser tab that rewrites its entire window management paradigm,
UI chrome, input model, and workspace semantics at runtime without destroying open applications, file system state, or
user context. One session, six switchable desktop modes.

It runs Flash, DOS, and console emulators, WebAssembly runtimes, and standard web apps side by side on a persistent
client-side filesystem, and it is built entirely in vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks.

# Desktop Environments

YukiOS ships six complete desktop paradigms, each a switchable mode of the same core. Pick any mode from the session
picker at login, or switch live. Every mode shares the same running applications, open files, persistent settings, and
IndexedDB-backed filesystem.

## 🍎 macOS Shell

A full macOS-inspired desktop with top menu bar, animated fisheye dock, Launchpad, and Control Center.

- **Top menu bar** with Start Menu and Finder access through macOS-style category menus
- **Animated fisheye dock** where pinned apps scale and push neighbors on hover, open apps auto-pin, and items are
  draggable to reorder
- **Control Center tray** with brightness, volume, battery, power mode, dark mode, dock toggle, accent colors, and lock
  screen
- **Traffic light window buttons** on all window headers
- **Launchpad** (F4) with a fullscreen app grid, glassmorphism backdrop, live search, slide-from-dock animation, bigger
  icons on hover, and hover-zoom, pinned to the Dock in Mac Mode

## 🎮 Yuki Deck Mode

A fullscreen, animated and full-sfx game-console-style environment you can pick at login, controlled with a gamepad or
keyboard/mouse, with home feed and library management.

- **Home feed** with new releases, friends activity, and recommended games
- **Game library** to search, sort by name, mark favorites, and build collections
- **Quick Actions Panel** to manage deck quick settings and friends list
- **In-game overlay** (Shift+Tab) with playtime tracking, friends panel, screenshot capture, performance monitor, and
  in-overlay web browser

## 🌐 ChromeOS Mode

A lightweight, tab-centric web-first environment with a dedicated shelf layout optimized for browser workflows.

- Shelf-style taskbar with pinned web apps and running indicators
- Tab-oriented windowing model for rapid web app switching
- Simplified system tray with essential controls
- Lightweight profile optimized for lower-resource machines

## 🔲 Hyprland BSP Tiling Mode

A keyboard-driven Binary Space Partitioning tiling window manager inspired by Hyprland, switchable from the session
picker, with per-workspace tree layouts and live config reloading.

- **Alt+Space** toggles tiling on/off; **Alt+Arrow** moves focus, **Ctrl+Alt+Arrow** resizes boundaries,
  **Alt+Shift+Arrow** swaps windows
- **9 independent workspaces** (Alt+1-9), each with its own BSP tree; **Alt+Q** closes focused window, **Alt+F** toggles
  floating, **Alt+T** spawns terminal
- **Drag-to-swap**: drag a tiled window onto another to swap positions in the tree
- **Live config**: gap, border width, and split ratio adjustable from Settings > Tiling or the config file at
  `Config/yukiOs/tiling.conf` (live-reload on save); customizable with gaps (inner/outer), split ratio, border
  width/radius, resize step, animation duration/easing, mouse resize toggle, workspace switch delay, and resize debounce
- **hyprctl** terminal command for Hyprland-style CLI control

## 🧊 3D OS Mode

A 3d fps game where player can walk around in a room and interact with computer monitor, grab and launch game cases that
hide game and open inside os page, or play sorting minigame

## ⚡ Yuki Native Session

The default hybrid desktop layout, a modern, high-density multitasking environment blending familiar desktop conventions
with YukiOS-specific innovations.

- Full floating window management with snapping, workspaces, and animations
- Desktop widgets, system tray, notification center
- Start menu with fuzzy search, favorites, and category management
- Configurable taskbar placement on any screen edge

---

## Architecture

YukiOS uses a shared-state architecture. Switching from Hyprland tiling to macOS shell does not destroy your open
applications, file system, or workspace context. The UI layout engine morphs around the running state.

### Under the Hood

- **Persistent Runtime:** Open apps, files, and state survive desktop mode swaps—only the window manager and shell UI
  change.
- **Pure Vanilla JS:** No runtime UI framework; built with plain JavaScript and Vite tooling.
- **Custom BSP Engine:** Real-time binary tree tiling with live configuration updates and `hyprctl` CLI controls.
- **State Persistence:** Settings, filesystem, and window state persist across mode switches via IndexedDB.

# 🛠 Build & Deployment

```bash
pnpm run dev          # Development server
pnpm run build:dev    # Development build
pnpm run build        # Production build
pnpm run preview      # Preview production build
```

## Editing System Source

The OS source is shown as a System folder inside explorer, so you can browse and edit it in place.

- Open Files, go to This PC, and open System.
- Open a file, edit it, and save. On the dev server ,app reloads and your change applies right away, meanwhile in
  production build its read only.

# 🤝 Contributing

See the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).

# 🖥️ Electron Desktop App

A native Electron wrapper for enhanced desktop integration:

- Native game windows that launch in their own OS-level window with auto-hide menu bar
- Remote host to stream your real desktop with mouse/keyboard control from any device
- Autostart YukiOS on system startup
- Browse real files via home directory drive in Explorer

The web-only version runs in any browser with all core features intact; the Electron app adds native OS integration on
top.
